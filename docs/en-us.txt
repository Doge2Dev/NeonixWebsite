[1. Introduction

The NXMI file is a file based on the windows architecture of files or "INI", its syntax is the same as the format but it is attributed to things related to the game. It was created to have more key information on maps in the Neonix game!
This includes things written by the game users themselves.

the name NXMI comes from the acronym for Neonix Map Information

[2] - Information structure

The information structure of these files is based on 2 main groups:

[nxmi] and [nxmap]

the group that has the format name (nxmi) stores information about the map itself.

mapName : Map name
author : author of the map
songName : song name

These 3 values ​​(string) are in the NXMI group.

The NXMAP group stores map information

initSpeed ​​: Player speed when starting the map
initGamemode : Player game mode when starting the map (0 = Normal mode, 1 = Floater mode)

[3] - Dynamic commands

In addition to saving this information, the NXMI can save and execute predefined commands that act as a trigger



{channelCount} : Syntax [channelCount=(int type number)]


saves the amount of color channels the map has
Ex: 5 color channels, this command must have the same amount of color channels


{channelColorSleep} : Syntax [channelColorSleep=(int type number)]

command that waits a time (in milliseconds) to change color channel
NOTE: This command only works if the channelTransitionType command has a value equal to "timer"


{channelTransitionType} : Syntax [channelTransitionType=(string type text)]


command waits for transition type, valid commands are timer, death, orbcheck.


timer : Works together with channelColorSleep command and changes the color channel at set time (in milliseconds)

death : Activates when the player dies, upon detecting a player's death it switches the color channel

orbcheck : Similar to "death", it activates when the player uses a "boost" orb

[4] - Defining colors

To define a color, the following structure must be followed.

[id_color]
r=red
g=green
b=blue

Inside the square brackets must contain a number, referring to the "ID" of the color channel
below these square brackets should contain these values ​​of RG and B, containing integers from 0 to 255

ex:
[2]
r=255
g=255
b=255
